# 🧠 Deep Learning Image Classification - Internship Task 2 (Codetech)

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **TensorFlow** to classify images from the **Fashion MNIST dataset**. It was developed as part of my internship with **Codetech**.

---

## 📌 Task Objective

> Implement a Deep Learning model for image classification using TensorFlow or PyTorch.  
Deliverable: A functional model with visualizations of results.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Used Fashion MNIST dataset (70,000 grayscale images)
- 🧠 Built a CNN with 2 Conv layers + MaxPooling
- 📈 Visualized training and validation performance
- 🔄 Saved the model for future predictions
- 🎯 Achieved over **90% accuracy**
